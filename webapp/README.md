# Rest sevices monitoring interface

## Requirements

- node and npm

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:scotch-io/node-token-authentication`
2. Install dependencies: `npm run install`
3. Change SECRET in `config.js`
4. Add your own MongoDB database to `config.js`
5. Start the server: `node server.js`
6. Create sample user by visiting: `http://localhost:8080/setup`

Once everything is set up, we can begin to use our app by creating and verifying tokens.
